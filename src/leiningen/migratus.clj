(defn migratus
  "Maintain database migrations.

Run migrations against a store.  The :migratus key in project.clj is passed to
migratus as configuration.

Usage `lein migratus [command & ids]`.  Where 'command' is:

migrate  Bring up any migrations that are not completed.
rollback BRing down the last applied migration.
up       Bring up the migrations specified by their ids.  Skips any migrations
         that are already up.
down     Bring down the migrations specified by their ids.  Skips any migrations
         that are already down.
create   Create a new migration file with the current date and the given name.
Destroy  Destroy a migration file with the given name.

If you run `lein migratus` without specifying a command, then the 'migrate'
command will be executed."
